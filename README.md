# Lotus

Lotus flowers are symbolic of rebirth and enlightenment, and serve as a representation of human life. *Lotus* is intended to be an ethereal realm that consists of recognizable natural elements, beginning with the lotus flower. It could potentially expand to further abstraction, through the process of exploring the context of what nature/humanity comes to mean (symbolically) in virtual space.

This project is currently in progress.
